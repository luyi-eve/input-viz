# Input Visualization
## Phase 1: Collecting (using visuals to gather data)

This is an input visualization instructed by [Vinicius Sueiro](https://vsueiro.com). 

- The goal of this project is to use visuals to collect data with advanced knowledge of Javascript.
- The project is designed to interact with users about the number of abortion clinics in the state of Florida: 
1⃣️ First, users will make a guess about the number by selecting the county where she/he/they live and dragging the handle below to a specific number.
2⃣️ Then, users will be able to check if their guesses is right or not by clicking the county map below. The correct number of each county will pop up for review.
- The data I'll be collecting from users will be used to explore and analyze the gap between the reality and public opinions on the numbers of the clinics.
