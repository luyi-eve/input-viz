# Input Visualization
## Phase 1: Collecting (using visuals to gather data)

This is an input visualization instructed by [Vinicius Sueiro](https://vsueiro.com). 

- The goal of this project is to use visuals to collect data with advanced knowledge of Javascript.
- The project is designed to interact with its users about the number of abortion clinics in the state of Florida. 
- The data I'll be collecting from users will be used to explore and analyze the gap is between the reality and public opinions on the actual numbers of the clinics.
