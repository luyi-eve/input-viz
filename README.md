# Input Visualization
## Phase 1: Collecting (using visuals to gather data)

This is an input visualization instructed by [Vinicius Sueiro](https://vsueiro.com). 

- The goal of this project is to use visuals to collect data with advanced knowledge of Javascript.
- The project was designed to interact with its users about the number of abortion clinics in the state of Florida. 
- The data I collected from users were used to analyze how big or small the gap is between the reality and public opinions on the actual numbers of the clinics.
